    "text": "Summary\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) are releasing this joint advisory to disseminate known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with threat actors deploying the LummaC2 information stealer (infostealer) malware. LummaC2 malware is able to infiltrate victim computer networks and exfiltrate sensitive information, threatening vulnerable individuals\u2019 and organizations\u2019 computer networks across multiple U.S. critical infrastructure sectors. According to FBI information and trusted third-party reporting, this activity has been observed as recently as May 2025. The IOCs included in this advisory were associated with LummaC2 malware infections from November 2023 through May 2025.\nThe FBI and CISA encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the\nMitigations\nsection of this advisory to reduce the likelihood and impact of LummaC2 malware."

Threat actors frequently use spearphishing hyperlinks and attachments to deploy LummaC2 malware payloads [\nT1566.001\n,\nT1566.002"

Additionally, threat actors rely on unsuspecting users to execute the payload by clicking a fake Completely Automated Public Turing Test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA).

After users press \u201center\u201d a subsequent Base64-encoded PowerShell process is executed.\nTo obfuscate their operations, threat actors have embedded and distributed LummaC2 malware within spoofed or fake popular software (i.e., multimedia player or utility software) [\nT1036\n]. The malware\u2019s obfuscation methods allow LummaC2 actors to bypass standard cybersecurity measures, such as Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions or antivirus programs, designed to flag common phishing attempts or drive-by downloads [\nT1027\n]."

Malicious cyber actors, including cybercriminals and nation-state actors, use fast flux to obfuscate the locations of malicious servers by rapidly changing Domain Name System (DNS) records. Additionally, they can create resilient, highly available command and control (C2) infrastructure, concealing their subsequent malicious operations. This resilient and fast changing infrastructure makes tracking and blocking malicious activities that use fast flux more difficult."

Medusa originally operated as a closed ransomware variant, meaning all development and associated operations were controlled by the same group of cyber threat actors. While Medusa has since progressed to using an affiliate model, important operations such as ransom negotiation are still centrally controlled by the developers. Both Medusa developers and affiliates\u2014referred to as \u201cMedusa actors\u201d in this advisory\u2014employ a double extortion model, where they encrypt victim data and threaten to publicly release exfiltrated data if a ransom is not paid.\nInitial Access\nMedusa developers typically recruit initial access brokers (IABs) in cybercriminal forums and marketplaces to obtain initial access [\nTA0001"

Once given an official notification of a vulnerability, the organization\u2019s network defenders began mitigating the vulnerability. Network defenders removed the site hosting the web shell from the public internet but did not take the server itself offline. A week later, network defenders officially declared an incident once they determined the web shell was used to breach the internal network. For several weeks, network defenders terminated much of the red team\u2019s access until the team maintained implants on only four hosts.

In addition, the organization did not require password protection of SSH private keys.\nNote:\nWithout a password protected key, an actor can more easily steal the private key and use it to authenticate to a system through SSH.\nThe organization had files in a home share that contained cleartext passwords.

In 2023, the majority of the most frequently exploited vulnerabilities were initially exploited as a zero-day, which is an increase from 2022, when less than half of the top exploited vulnerabilities were exploited as a zero-day.\nMalicious cyber actors continue to have the most success exploiting vulnerabilities within two years after public disclosure of the vulnerability. The utility of these vulnerabilities declines over time as more systems are patched or replaced. Malicious cyber actors find less utility from zero-day exploits when international cybersecurity efforts reduce the lifespan of zero-day vulnerabilities."

The actors likely aim to obtain credentials and information describing the victim\u2019s network that can then be sold to enable access to cybercriminals."

The activity includes cyber campaigns such as website defacements, infrastructure scanning, data exfiltration, and data leak operations. These actors sell or publicly release exfiltrated victim data obtained from their compromises.
