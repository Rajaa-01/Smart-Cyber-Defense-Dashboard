According to information and trusted third-party reporting, this activity has been observed as recently as May 2025. The included in this advisory were associated with malware infections from November 2023 through May 2025.

See the &CK Tactics and Techniques section of this advisory for threat actor activity mapped to &CK tactics and techniques. Overview malware first appeared for sale on multiple Russian-language speaking cybercriminal forums in 2022. Threat actors frequently use spearphishing hyperlinks and attachments to deploy malware payloads [ T1566.001 , T1566.002 ]. Additionally, threat actors rely on unsuspecting users to execute the payload by clicking a fake Completely Automated Public Turing Test to tell Computers and Humans Apart ().

After users press “enter” a subsequent Base64-encoded process is executed. To obfuscate their operations, threat actors have embedded and distributed malware within spoofed or fake popular software (i.e., multimedia player or utility software) [ T1036 ]. The malware’s obfuscation methods allow actors to bypass standard cybersecurity measures, such as Endpoint Detection and Response () solutions or antivirus programs, designed to flag common phishing attempts or drive-by downloads [ T1027 ].

If both values match, a final subroutine will be called with a static value of the computer name hash as an argument. If this routine is reached, the process will terminate.

Malicious cyber actors, including cybercriminals and nation-state actors, use fast flux to obfuscate the locations of malicious servers by rapidly changing Domain Name System () records. Additionally, they can create resilient, highly available command and control (C2) infrastructure, concealing their subsequent malicious operations.

Technical details When malicious cyber actors compromise devices and networks, the malware they use needs to “call home” to send status updates and receive further instructions. To decrease the risk of detection by network defenders, malicious cyber actors use dynamic resolution techniques, such as fast flux, so their communications are less likely to be detected as malicious and blocked.

Single flux A single domain name is linked to numerous IP addresses, which are frequently rotated in responses. This setup ensures that if one IP address is blocked or taken down, the domain remains accessible through the other IP addresses. See Figure 1 as an example to illustrate this technique.

See the &CK Tactics and Techniques section of this advisory for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to &CK tactics and techniques. Background The RaaS Medusa variant has been used to conduct ransomware attacks from 2021 to present. Medusa originally operated as a closed ransomware variant, meaning all development and associated operations were controlled by the same group of cyber threat actors. While Medusa has since progressed to using an affiliate model, important operations such as ransom negotiation are still centrally controlled by the developers. Both Medusa developers and affiliates—referred to as “Medusa actors” in this advisory—employ a double extortion model, where they encrypt victim data and threaten to publicly release exfiltrated data if a ransom is not paid. Initial Access Medusa developers typically recruit initial access brokers () in cybercriminal forums and marketplaces to"

Despite Ghost actors’ malicious implementation, Cobalt Strike is a commercially available adversary simulation tool often used for the purposes of testing an organization’s security controls. Persistence Persistence is not a major focus for Ghost actors, as they typically only spend a few days on victim networks. In multiple instances, they have been observed proceeding from initial compromise to the deployment of ransomware within the same day. However, Ghost actors sporadically create new local [ T1136.001 ] and domain accounts [ T1136.002 ] and change passwords for existing accounts [ T1098 ].

After obtaining credentials, the actors logged in and exploited -2024-9380 to execute commands from a higher privileged account. The actors successfully sent a request to /gsb/reports[.]php .

Lateral Movement In one case, there was evidence of lateral movement after the threat actors gained access and established a foothold through this exploit chain. It is suspected that the threat actors gained access into a Jenkins server running a vulnerable, outdated version [ T1068 ]. Logs on the Jenkins machine showed that a command in the bash history contained credentials to the postgres server. The threat actors then attempted to log into the Virtual Private Network () server but were unsuccessful. Prior to moving laterally, the actors likely performed discovery on the device using Obelisk and to scan for vulnerabilities [ T1595.002 ]. Exploit Chain 2 In one confirmed compromise, the actors used a similar exploit chain, exploiting -2024-8963 in conjunction with -2024-9379, using /client/index.php%3f.php/gsb/broker.php for initial access.

The actors likely aim to obtain credentials and information describing the victim’s network that can then be sold to enable access to cybercriminals.
